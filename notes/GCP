can be broadly categorized as: compute,storage, bigdata and application services for web, mobile, analytics
and back-end solutions

#### Cloud Computing
customers get computing resources that are on-demmand and self-service. through a web interface, users get
the processing power, storage and networking they require, without a human intervation
customers get access to those resources over the internet from anywhere they have a connection
the cloud provider has a big pool of those resources and allocates them to users out of that pool
rosources are elastic-which means they are flexible, so customers can be. if customers need more resources 
they can get more, and quickly. if they need less, they can scale back
and finally, customers pay only for what they use

a container-based architecture-a fully automated, elastic third-wave cloud

first wave -> colocation. renting phisycal space instead of investing in data center and colocation 
facilities of decades past
second wave -> virtualized data center. similar a colocation, private dc. enterprises still maintain
the infra, but it also remains a user-controlled and user-configured environment. -> pq isso é ruim? 

in the future, every company -regardless of size or industry- will differentiate itself from its 
competitors through technology. that technology will be in form of software. great software is based
on high-quality data -> every company is, or will eventually become, a data company

#### Network
each location is divided into several different regions and zones.
regions represent independent geographic areas and are composed of zones.
if you launch a virtual machione using compute engine it will run in the zone that you specify to
ensure resource redundancy.
você pode rodar recursos em diferentes regions. useful for bringing applications closer to  users 
around the world, and also for protection in case tehere are issues with an entire region, say, due to 
a natural disaster.

spanner multi-region configurations allow you to replicate the db's data not just in multiple zones, but
in multiple zones across multiple regions, as defined by the instance configuration
