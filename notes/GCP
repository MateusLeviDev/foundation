GOOGLE CLOUD FUNDAMENTALS: CORE INFRA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

can be broadly categorized as: compute,storage, bigdata and application services for web, mobile, analytics
and back-end solutions

- identify the purpose and value of Google Cloud products and services 
- define how infrastructure is organized and controlled in google cloud
- explain how to create a basic infra in google cloud
- select and use google cloud storage options
- describe the purpose and value of google kubernetes engine
- identify the use cases for severless google cloud services
- combine google cloud knowledge with prompt engineering to improve gemini responses


#### Cloud Computing
customers get computing resources that are on-demmand and self-service. through a web interface, users get
the processing power, storage and networking they require, without a human intervation
customers get access to those resources over the internet from anywhere they have a connection
the cloud provider has a big pool of those resources and allocates them to users out of that pool
rosources are elastic-which means they are flexible, so customers can be. if customers need more resources 
they can get more, and quickly. if they need less, they can scale back
and finally, customers pay only for what they use

a container-based architecture-a fully automated, elastic third-wave cloud

first wave -> colocation. renting phisycal space instead of investing in data center and colocation 
facilities of decades past
second wave -> virtualized data center. similar a colocation, private dc. enterprises still maintain
the infra, but it also remains a user-controlled and user-configured environment. -> pq isso é ruim? 

in the future, every company -regardless of size or industry- will differentiate itself from its 
competitors through technology. that technology will be in form of software. great software is based
on high-quality data -> every company is, or will eventually become, a data company

#### Network
each location is divided into several different regions and zones.
regions represent independent geographic areas and are composed of zones.
if you launch a virtual machione using compute engine it will run in the zone that you specify to
ensure resource redundancy.
você pode rodar recursos em diferentes regions. useful for bringing applications closer to  users 
around the world, and also for protection in case tehere are issues with an entire region, say, due to 
a natural disaster.

spanner multi-region configurations allow you to replicate the db's data not just in multiple zones, but
in multiple zones across multiple regions, as defined by the instance configuration

#### IAM
to restrict who has access to what.

There are three kinds of roles in IAM: basic, predefined, and custom.

Basic roles are quite broad (mto amplo) in scope. When applied to a Google Cloud project, they affect all resources 
in that project. Basic roles include owner, editor, viewer, and billing administrator.

predefined roles. With Compute Engine, you can apply specific predefined roles—such as “instanceAdmin”—to Compute 
Engine resources in a given project, a given folder, or an entire organization.

custom roles. Many companies use a “least-privilege” model in which each person in your organization is given the 
minimal amount of privilege needed to do their job. atenção. First, you’ll need to manage 
the permissions that define the custom role you’ve created. Because of this, some organizations decide they’d rather use 
the predefined roles. And second, custom roles can only be applied to either the project level or organization level. They 
can’t be applied to the folder level.

order these iam role types from broadest to finest-grained: basic roles, predefined roles, custom-roles


#### Service accounts
What if you want to give permissions to a Compute Engine virtual machine, rather than to a person?

Well, that’s what service accounts are for.

Let’s say you have an application running in a virtual machine that needs to store data in Cloud Storage, but you don’t want 
anyone on the internet to have access to that data–just that particular virtual machine. 
Service accounts are named with an email address, but instead of passwords they use cryptographic keys to access resources. 
Fortunately, in addition to being an identity, a service account is also a resource, so 
it can have IAM policies of its own attached to it.

- the project id is immutable after creation, but can be changed during creation
- services and apis are enabled on a per-project basis

#### interacting with google cloud
- google cloud console web-based interface
- cloud sdk and cloud shell -all the tools within the cloud sdk located under the bin directory
- other way is through APIs
- the fourth way google cloud app
